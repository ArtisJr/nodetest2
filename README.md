# Nodetest2

## Before Running

You will need to have mongo installed and configured. Create a data folder (`mkdir data`) in the repo locally. The `mongod` start up script is shown below.

> `mongod --dbpath=C:/**YOUR_PATH_TO/nodetest2/data`

After `mongod` is running open a mongo shell and run the following.

1. `mongo`
2. `use nodetest2`

Close the mongo shell. Now you can begin running the application.

## Starting the Application

Run `npm start` in command prompt/terminal. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000/.
